Solutions for advent of code 2018.
My purpose was to learn assembler basics and get more fluent with writing it by hand.
At some time it got really complicated for me (TODO rewrite in asm :shipit:), so some parts are accompanied with C files

Requirements to run solutions:
- cmake
- gcc
- nasm

To build all solutions, create `build` directory and simply write `cmake <path to root of repository>`, eg. `cmake ..`
